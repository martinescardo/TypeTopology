# Martin Escardo, 31st December 2025.  Script to typecheck
# TypeTopology fast exploiting multicore.  The difference of this
# script with the `multicore` script is that we don't regenerate the
# auxiliary index files and instead use the existing ones. This is
# intended for when a particularly favourable random selection is
# found by the `multicore` script.
#
# For an explanation of the delay argument, see the script multicore.
