# Various new theorems in constructive univalent mathematics written in Agda

This development was started by Martin Escardo in 2010, and
transferred to github Monday 5th February 2018. A few files are
authored by collaborators or external contributors, with names added
at the top.

If you contribute, please add your full (legal or adopted) name and date
at the place of contribution.

An [html rendering of the Agda
code](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/TypeTopology/index.html) is hosted at
Martin Escardo's institutional web page.

## How to cite

You can use the following BibTeX citation to cite `TypeTopology`:

```bibtex
@misc{type-topology,
  title    = {{TypeTopology}},
  author   = {Escard\'{o}, Mart\'{i}n H. and {contributors}},
  url      = {https://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology},
  note     = {{Agda} development},
}
```

If you are citing only your files, then create a different bibtex file
with only your name as author.
