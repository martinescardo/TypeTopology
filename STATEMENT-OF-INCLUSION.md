# Statement of inclusion

There are many reasons to contribute something to a library of formalized
mathematics. Some do it just for fun, some do it for their research, some do it
to learn something. Whatever your reason is, we welcome your contributions! To
keep the experience of contributing something to our library enjoyable for
everyone, we strive for an inclusive community of contributors. You can expect
from us that we are kind and respectful in discussions, that we will be mindful
of your pronouns and use
[inclusive language](https://www.apa.org/about/apa/equity-diversity-inclusion/language-guidelines),
and that we value your input regardless of your level of experience or status in
the community. We're committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment to
people of any gender identity, sexual orientation, race, colour, age, ability,
ethnicity, background, or fluency in English -- here on GitHub, in online
communication channels, and in person. Homotopy type theory is difficult enough
without all the barriers that many of us have to face, so we hope to bring some
of those down a bit.

We have borrowed this statement literally from [agda-unimath](https://github.com/UniMath/agda-unimath/tree/master) with Egbert Rijke's permission.
