# Exact Real Search: Formalised Optimisation and Regression in Constructive Univalent Mathematics

A [thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09270) to the University of
Birmingham for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

## Abstract

The real numbers are important in both mathematics and computation
theory. Computationally, real numbers can be represented in several
ways; most commonly using inexact floating-point data-types, but also
using exact arbitrary-precision data-types which satisfy the expected
mathematical properties of the reals.
This thesis is concerned with formalising properties of certain types
for exact real arithmetic, as well as utilising them computationally
for the purposes of search, optimisation and regression.

We develop, in a constructive and univalent type-theoretic foundation
of mathematics, a formalised framework for performing search,
optimisation and regression on a wide class of types.
This framework utilises Martin Escardo's prior work on searchable
types, along with a convenient version of ultrametric spaces --- which
we call closeness spaces --- in order to consistently search certain
infinite types using the functional programming language and proof
assistant Agda.

We formally define and prove the convergence properties of
type-theoretic variants of global optimisation and parametric
regression, problems related to search from the literature of
analysis.
As we work in a constructive setting, these convergence theorems yield
computational algorithms for correct optimisation and regression on
the types of our framework.

Importantly, we can instantiate our framework on data-types from the
literature of exact real arithmetic.
The types for representing real numbers that we use are the ternary
signed-digit encodings and a simplified version of Hans-J. Boehm's
functional encodings.
Furthermore, we contribute to the extensive work on ternary
signed-digits by formally verifying the definition of certain exact
real arithmetic operations using the Escardo-Simpson interval object
specification of compact intervals.

With this instantiation, we are able to perform our variants of
search, optimisation and regression on representations of the real
numbers.
These three processes comprise our framework of exact real search; we
close the thesis by providing some computational examples of this
framework in practice.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

In [Chapter 1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09270.pdf#chapter.1),
we motivate the work of using searchable types in
order to construct algorithms for global optimisation and parametric
regression on the ternary-signed digits.

## Chapter 2: Constructive Univalent Type Theory in Agda

In [Chapter 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09270.pdf#chapter.2), we
introduce the key concepts of our constructive and univalent
type-theoretic foundation of mathematics in which we build our formal
framework for search, optimisation and regression.

## Chapter 3: Searchability and Continuity

In [Chapter 3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09270.pdf#chapter.3), we
review and define the two key mathematical concepts of the thesis:
*searchability* and *uniform continuity*.

We build on the [previous work](../../TypeTopology/TypeTopology.CompactTypes.html)
of Martin Escardo, contributing a method of searching certain infinite
types in Agda by using explicit information about uniform continuity
of the predicate being searched. This [notion of uniform continuity](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter3.ClosenessSpace.html#p-ucontinuous)
is defined on a convenient version of ultrametric spaces that we call
[closeness spaces](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter3.ClosenessSpace.html#ClosenessSpace).

We also give a version of the totally bounded property for closeness
spaces, and show that a variety of types yield closeness spaces.
The key technical contribution of this section is the formalised
result which shows these uniformly continuously searchable types are
[closed under countable products](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter3.SearchableTypes-Examples.html#tychonoff).

```

## Chapter 4: Generalised Optimisation and Regression

In [Chapter 4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09270.pdf#chapter.4), we use
uniformly continuously searchable closeness spaces to define our formal
convergence properties of global optimisation and parametric regression
on a wide class of types. For this purpose, we introduce [approximate linear preorders](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter4.ApproxOrder.html#is-approx-order),
which approximately order elements of closeness spaces. The key
contribution of this section --- the statement of the type-theoretic
variants of [global optimisation](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter4.GlobalOptimisation.html#global-opt)
and [parametric regression](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter4.ParametricRegression.html#s-imperfect-convergence)
--- is methodological rather than technical, as the proofs of their
convergence follow naturally from the concepts we have introduced.

```

## Chapter 5: Real Numbers

In [Chapter 5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09270.pdf#chapter.5), we
define two types for representing real numbers: [ternary signed-digit encodings](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.SignedDigit.html#ùüõ·¥∫)
and [ternary Boehm encodings](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.BoehmVerification.html#ùïã).

On the former, we formally verify exact real arithmetic operations
(namely, [negation](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.SignedDigitIntervalObject.html#neg-realiser),
[binary](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.SignedDigitIntervalObject.html#mid-realiser)
and [infinitary midpoint](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.SignedDigitIntervalObject.html#bigMid-realiser)
and [multiplication](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.SignedDigitIntervalObject.html#mul-realiser))
using the [Escardo-Simpson interval object specification of closed intervals](TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.IntervalObject.html#Interval-object)
--- which we also review and formalise in this section.

On the latter, we [define the type](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.BoehmVerification.html#ùïã)
in Agda, [prove the correctness of its structure](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.BoehmVerification.html#ternary-normalised‚âÉùïã)
and show how it [yields representations](/TWA.Thesis.Chapter5.BoehmVerification.html#CompactInterval)
of compact intervals that we can then use for search.

## Chapter 6: Exact Real Search

In [Chapter 6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09270.pdf#chapter.6), we
bring our formal framework full-circle by instantiating it on these two
types for representing real numbers. 
Example evaluations of algorithms for search, optimisation and
regression --- either [extracted from Agda](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09270.pdf#appendix.A)
or [implemented in Java](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09270.pdf#appendix.B)
--- are then given to show the use of the framework in practice.

```

## Chapter 7: Conclusion

Finally, in [Chapter 7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09270.pdf#chapter.7),
by way of conclusion we discuss some further avenues for this line of
work.
