We demonstrate the upwards absoluteness of compactness, by using it to
give an alternative proof of the Micro Tychonoff theorem (as proved in
the module TypeTopology.MicroTychonoff).

module TypeTopology.AbsolutenessOfCompactnessExample
 (fe : funext 𝓤 𝓤)
 (P : 𝓤 ̇ )
 (P-is-prop : is-prop P)
 where

\end{code}

We are given a proposition P as a parameter and function
extensionality. We use this in a sequence of module imports.

First of all, we give P to the open modality module, as well as
function extensionality to get results about the open modality on P.

\begin{code}

open Modal.Open fe P P-is-prop

\end{code}

The open modality module gives us proofs that the open modality is
reflective and Σ-closed. We hand these off to the
SigmaClosedReflectiveSubuniverse module.

\begin{code}

open Modal.SigmaClosedReflectiveSubuniverse
 open-subuniverse open-is-reflective open-is-sigma-closed

\end{code}

We also hand off the open modality as a parameter to the
AbsolutenessOfCompactness module.

\begin{code}

open TypeTopology.AbsolutenessOfCompactness
 open-subuniverse open-is-reflective

\end{code}

Finally, we recall that AbsolutenessOfCompactness has a submodule that
requires the extra assumptions of function extensionality and that the
reflective subuniverse is Σ-closed and replete. We have all of these,
so we pass them on as parameters to the submodule.

\begin{code}

open WithFunExtAndRepleteSigmaClosed
 fe open-is-sigma-closed open-is-replete

\end{code}

If we apply the theorems in AbsolutenessOfCompactness directly, the
best we can get is the following non dependent version of
propositional Tychonoff.

\begin{code}

non-dependent-prop-tychonoff
 : (A : 𝓤 ̇ )
 → (P → is-compact∙ A)
 → is-compact∙ (P → A)
non-dependent-prop-tychonoff = modalities-preserve-compact

\end{code}

In order to get a new proof of propositional Tychonoff, we need to
show how to derive it from the non-dependent version.

\begin{code}

prop-tychonoff₂
 : (A : P → 𝓤 ̇ )
 → ((z : P) → is-compact∙ (A z))
 → is-compact∙ (Π A)
prop-tychonoff₂ A A-compact = ΠA-compact
 where

\end{code}

We are given a family of types A : P → 𝓤 ̇ and we aim to apply the
non-dependent version above to the product Π A. In order to do this,
there are two things to check. Firstly, we have to show that P implies
Π A is compact. This allows us to apply the non-dependent version
above, which shows that P → Π A is compact. We then need to deduce
from this that in fact Π A is compact.

The first step, of showing that P implies Π A compact, is copied
straight from the original propositional Tychonoff proof. Namely, if P
is true, as witnessed by an inhabitant z, then Π A is equivalent to A
z, and so is compact.

\begin{code}

  𝕗 : (z : P) → Π A ≃ A z
  𝕗 z = prop-indexed-product z fe P-is-prop

  product-locally-compact : P → is-compact∙ (Π A)
  product-locally-compact z =
   compact∙-types-are-closed-under-equiv
    (≃-sym (𝕗 z)) (A-compact z)

\end{code}

We can now apply the non dependent version above to show that P → Π A
is compact.

\begin{code}

  P→ΠA-compact : is-compact∙ (P → Π A)
  P→ΠA-compact =
   non-dependent-prop-tychonoff (Π A) product-locally-compact

\end{code}

To deduce that Π A is compact, it suffices to show that it is
equivalent to P → Π A. This can be shown directly, but we will give a
slightly more abstract proof using general results about
modalities.

First note that given z : P, we known that P is true and so every type
is modal for the open modality on P. Hence, in particular A z is
modal.

\begin{code}

  A-modal : (z : P) → is-modal (A z)
  A-modal z = P-true-implies-all-modal z (A z)

\end{code}

Since A is a family of modal types its product Π A is also modal.

\begin{code}

  ΠA-modal : is-modal (Π A)
  ΠA-modal =
   products-of-modal-types-are-modal
    fe open-is-replete P A A-modal

\end{code}

However, the fact that Π A is modal precisely tells us that the unit
map of the modality Π A → (P → Π A) is an equivalence.

Putting this together with the earlier proof that P → Π A is modal
allows us to complete the proof of the theorem.

\begin{code}

  ΠA-compact : is-compact∙ (Π A)
  ΠA-compact =
   compact∙-types-are-closed-under-equiv
    (≃-sym ((open-unit (Π A)) , ΠA-modal))
    P→ΠA-compact

\end{code}
