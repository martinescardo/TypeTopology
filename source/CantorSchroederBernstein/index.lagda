Martin Escardo, January 2020.

The Cantor-Schröder-Berntein Theorem, under the assumption of excluded
middle, generalized from sets to (homotopy) types.

The result holds in any boolean ∞-topos. It says that if there is an
embedding of a type X to a type Y, and also from Y to X, then the
types X and Y are equivalent.

The file CSB led to the publication

 [1] M. H. Escardo. The Cantor–Schröder–Bernstein Theorem for
     ∞-groupoids. Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures.

After that, in 2025, Fredrik Bakke added the last two files, with a
version of CSB that

 1. weakens the assumption of excluded middle to WLPO, and
 2. on the other hand, requires stronger assumptions on the two embeddings.

Notice that (2) is absolutely necessary, in the presence of (1),
because Pradic and Brown previously showed that CSB for (even just
sets) implies excluded middle
