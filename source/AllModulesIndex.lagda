   Tested with Agda 2.8.0
   (it will probably work with Agda 2.7.0.1, and it may still work with Agda 2.6.4.3).

This file hereditarily imports all TypeTopology files. Most of them
are --safe. All of them are --without-K. See discussion below for
details, and also the following Agda manual entries.

See the module (2) below for an explanation of the philosophy of
TypeTopology, and in particular which type theory is adopted.

\begin{code}

{-# OPTIONS --without-K --no-level-universe --guardedness #-}

import index                                -- (1)
import GamesMGU.index                       -- (2)
import MonadOnTypesMGU.index                -- (2)
import RelativeMonadOnStructuredTypes.index -- (2)
import Unsafe.index                         -- (3)
import InfinitePigeon.index                 -- (4)

\end{code}

(1) Of --safe modules using --without-K and --level-universe.
(2) Of modules with --safe and --without-K but --no-level-universe.
(3) Of unsafe modules.
(4) Of modules that disable termination check for bar recursion.
    These modules *should* be safe in some sense, but Agda can't tell this,
    and so the checking needs to be done by mathematicians and/or logicians.

Notice that, currently, all modules use --without-K.

The default options for all modules are (as listed in
typetopology.agda-lib, which should be taken as the authoritative
source of information if this list gets obsolete)

  --auto-inline
  --exact-split
  --keep-pattern-variables
  --level-universe
  --no-cohesion
  --no-cumulativity
  --no-erasure
  --no-guardedness
  --no-print-pattern-synonyms
  --no-prop
  --no-rewriting
  --no-save-metas
  --no-sized-types
  --no-two-level
  --without-K

But all modules should add the option --without-K, to emphasize an
essential point in the philosophy of TypeTopology, which is to be
compatible with univalent type theory.

An option is *coinfective* if whenever it is used in a module, it must
be used in all modules imported by that module. The following options
are coinfective:

  --safe
  --without-K
  --no-universe-polymorphism
  --no-sized-types
  --no-guardedness
  --level-universe

An option is *infective* if whenever it is used in one module, it must
be used in all modules that import module. At the moment, TypeTopology
infective options are

  --no-termination-check
  --guardedness

Navigate to the corresponding files to see which (infective or
coinfective) options they use.
