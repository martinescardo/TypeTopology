We define connected types and maps. We then explore relationships, closure
properties and characterizations of interest pertaining to the concept of
connectedness.

\begin{code}

{-# OPTIONS --safe --without-K #-}

open import UF.FunExt

module UF.ConnectedTypes
        (fe : Fun-Ext)
       where
                          
open import MLTT.Spartan hiding (_+_)
open import Notation.Order
open import UF.Equiv
open import UF.EquivalenceExamples
open import UF.PropTrunc 
open import UF.Subsingletons
open import UF.Subsingletons-FunExt
open import UF.Truncations fe
open import UF.TruncationLevels
open import UF.TruncatedTypes fe
open import UF.Univalence

\end{code}

We now define the notion of connectedness for types and functions with respect
to truncation levels.

\begin{code}

module _ (te : general-truncations-exist) where

 private 
  pt : propositional-truncations-exist
  pt = general-truncations-give-propositional-truncations te

 open general-truncations-exist te
 open propositional-truncations-exist pt
 open import UF.ImageAndSurjection pt

 _is_connected : 𝓤 ̇ → ℕ₋₂ → 𝓤 ̇
 X is k connected = is-contr (∥ X ∥[ k ])

 _is_connected-map : {X : 𝓤 ̇} {Y : 𝓥 ̇} → (f : X → Y) → ℕ₋₂ → 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥 ̇
 f is k connected-map = each-fiber-of f (λ - → - is k connected)

\end{code}

TODO: show that connectedness as defined elsewhere in the library is
a special case of k-connectedness. Connectedness typically means set
connectedness, by our convention it will mean 0-connectedness.

We characterize −1-connected types as inhabited types and −1-connected maps as
surjections.

\begin{code}

 inhabited-if-−1-connected : {X : 𝓤 ̇}
                           → X is −1 connected → ∥ X ∥
 inhabited-if-−1-connected X-1-conn = −1-trunc-to-prop-trunc pt (center X-1-conn)

 −1-connected-if-inhabited : {X : 𝓤 ̇}
                           → ∥ X ∥ → X is −1 connected
 −1-connected-if-inhabited x-anon =
  pointed-props-are-singletons (prop-trunc-to-−1-trunc pt x-anon) −1-trunc-is-prop

 −1-connected-iff-inhabited : {X : 𝓤 ̇}
                            → X is −1 connected ↔ ∥ X ∥
 −1-connected-iff-inhabited =
  (inhabited-if-−1-connected , −1-connected-if-inhabited)

 map-is-surj-if-−1-connected : {X : 𝓤 ̇} {Y : 𝓥 ̇} {f : X → Y}
                             → f is −1 connected-map → is-surjection f
 map-is-surj-if-−1-connected m y = inhabited-if-−1-connected (m y)

 map-is-−1-connected-if-surj : {X : 𝓤 ̇} {Y : 𝓥 ̇} {f : X → Y}
                             → is-surjection f → f is −1 connected-map
 map-is-−1-connected-if-surj f-is-surj y = −1-connected-if-inhabited (f-is-surj y)

 map-is-−1-connected-iff-surj : {X : 𝓤 ̇} {Y : 𝓥 ̇} {f : X → Y}
                              → f is −1 connected-map ↔ is-surjection f
 map-is-−1-connected-iff-surj =
  (map-is-surj-if-−1-connected , map-is-−1-connected-if-surj)

\end{code}

We develop some closure conditions pertaining to connectedness. Connectedness
is closed under equivalence as expected, but more importantly connectedness
extends below: more precisely if a type is k connected then it is l connected
for all l ≤ k. We provide a few incarnations of this fact below which may prove
useful. 

\begin{code}

                                  → Y is k connected
                                  → X is k connected

 contractible-types-are-connected {𝓤} {X} {k} (c , C) = ((∣ c ∣[ k ]) , C')
  where
   C' : (s : ∥ X ∥[ k ]) → (∣ c ∣[ k ]) ＝ s
   C' = ∥∥ₙ-ind (truncation-levels-closed-under-Id ∥∥ₙ-is-truncated (∣ c ∣[ k ]))
                (λ x → ap ∣_∣[ k ] (C x))

                               → X is (k + 1) connected

                                 → X is (l + k) connected
                                 → X is l connected

  connectedness-is-lower-closed-+ (connectedness-is-lower-closed X-con)

 connectedness-is-lower-closed' : {X : 𝓤 ̇} {k l : ℕ₋₂}
                                → (l ≤ k)
                                → X is k connected
                                → X is l connected
 connectedness-is-lower-closed' {𝓤} {X} {k} {l} o X-con =
  connectedness-is-lower-closed-+ (transport (λ z → X is z connected) p X-con)
  where
   m : ℕ
   m = subtraction-ℕ₋₂-term l k o
   p = k       ＝⟨ subtraction-ℕ₋₂-identification l k o ⁻¹ ⟩

We characterize connected types in terms of inhabitedness and connectedness of
the identity type at one level below. We will assume univalence only when necessary.
