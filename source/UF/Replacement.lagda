The type theoretic axiom of replacement (section 24.5 of Introduction to
Homotopy Type Theory by Egbert Rijke:
https://ulrikbuchholtz.dk/hott1920/hott-intro.pdf)
is a statement about the size of the image of a function when certain smallness
assumptions are imposed on the domain and codomain. The nomenclature is derived
from the set-theoretic axiom of replacement, where the set vs class distinction
provides a notion of size. In type theory, this statement may be assumed or
proven depending on the context (see discussion below for details about the
strength of type replacement). We also mention that the file UF/Size.lagda
defines 'set replacement' which restricts type replacement to those maps whose
codomain is a set (in the sense of univalent foundations). We will drop the word
'axiom' and write 'type replacement', or simply 'replacement' when there is no
risk of confusion with set replacement.

The statement of type replacement is as follows:
The image of a map f : A → X, from a small type A to a locally small type X, is
itself small.

Note: some authors use the term 'essentially small' for what the TypeTopology
library refers to as simply 'small'. Additionally, we often wish to consider
size relative to an explicit universe.

The reader may be cautious about the strength of type replacement due to its
'apparent' connection with the axiom of replacement of set theory; the latter
is a rather strong assumption critical for more advanced set-theoretic results.
In contrast, type replacement is a rather modest assumption. Indeed it follows
from the existence of a restricted class of Higher Inductive Types (HITs). For
details see "The Join Construction" by Egbert Rijke
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07538) where 'graph quotients' are used to give an
alternative construction of the image; from which type replacement can be
proven. Additionally, one may carry out this construction simply with pushouts
(which can be shown to be equivalent to graph quotients). The join construction
via pushouts is being actively explored in files not yet publicly available.
Additionally, set replacement (see above) is equivalent to the existence of set
quotients, another modest assumption.

It is worth noting that the status of type replacements strength relative to
the strength of adding certain HITs is not completely understood, but it
appears to be even weaker than the assumption that pushouts exist (this
observation will follow from a forthcoming write up by Reid Barton). In light
of this, it is reasonable to explore type replacement and use it as an
independent assumption when neccesary.

\begin{code}

{-# OPTIONS --safe --without-K #-}

open import UF.PropTrunc

module UF.Replacement (pt : propositional-truncations-exist)
                       where

open import MLTT.Spartan
open import UF.Equiv
open import UF.ImageAndSurjection pt
open import UF.Size
open import UF.SmallnessProperties

open propositional-truncations-exist pt

\end{code}

We begin by giving a precise statement of type replacement.

\begin{code}

module _ {𝓥 : Universe} where

 Replacement : {𝓤 𝓦 : Universe} → (𝓥 ⊔ 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓦)⁺ ̇
 Replacement {𝓤} {𝓦} = {A : 𝓤 ̇ } {X : 𝓦 ̇ } (f : A → X)
                     → A is 𝓥 small
                     → X is-locally 𝓥 small
                     → image f is 𝓥 small

\end{code}

We can also give a variation of this statement when f is surjective.

\begin{code}

 Replacement' : {𝓤 𝓦 : Universe} → (𝓥 ⊔ 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓦)⁺ ̇
 Replacement' {𝓤} {𝓦} = {A : 𝓤 ̇ } {X : 𝓦 ̇ } (f : A → X)
                      → A is 𝓥 small
                      → X is-locally 𝓥 small
                      → is-surjection f
                      → X is 𝓥 small

\end{code}

Of course the two statements are inter-derivable.

\begin{code}

 Replacement-to-Replacement' : {𝓤 𝓦 : Universe}
                             → Replacement {𝓤} {𝓦} → Replacement' {𝓤} {𝓦}
 Replacement-to-Replacement' 𝓡 {_} {X} f A-small X-loc-small f-surj
  = smallness-closed-under-≃ I II
  where
   I : image f is 𝓥 small
   I = 𝓡 f A-small X-loc-small
   II : image f ≃ X
   II = surjection-≃-image f f-surj

 Replacement'-to-Replacement : {𝓤 𝓦 : Universe}
                             → Replacement' {𝓤} {𝓤 ⊔ 𝓦} → Replacement {𝓤} {𝓦}
 Replacement'-to-Replacement 𝓡' {A} {X} f A-small X-loc-small
  = 𝓡' (corestriction f) A-small I II
  where
   I : image f is-locally 𝓥 small
   I = subtype-is-locally-small' X-loc-small (λ - → ∥∥-is-prop)
   II : is-surjection (corestriction f)
   II = corestrictions-are-surjections f

\end{code}
