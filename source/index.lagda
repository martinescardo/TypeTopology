   The main new results are about compact types, totally separated
   types, compact ordinals and injective types, but there are many
   other things (see the clickable index below).

   * Our main use of this development is as a personal blackboard or
     notepad for our research. In particular, some modules have better
     and better results or approaches, as time progresses, with the
     significant steps kept, and with failed ideas and calculations
     eventually erased.

   * We offer this page as a preliminary announcement of results to be
     submitted for publication, of the kind we would get when we visit
     a mathematician's office.

   * We have also used this development for learning other people's
     results, and so some previously known constructions and theorems
     are included (sometimes with embellishments).

   * The required material on HoTT/UF has been developed on demand
     over the years to fullfil the needs of the above as they arise,
     and hence is somewhat chaotic. It will continue to expand as the
     need arises. Its form is the result of evolution rather than
     intelligent design (paraphrasing Linus Torvalds).

     Our lecture notes develop HoTT/UF in Agda in a more principled
     way, and offers better approaches to some constructions and
     simpler proofs of some (previously) difficult theorems.
     (https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF.in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/)

     Our philosophy, here and in the lecture notes, is to work with a
     minimal Martin-Löf type theory, and use principles from HoTT/UF
     (existence of propositional truncations, function extensionality,
     propositional extensionality, univalence, propositional resizing)
     and classical mathematics (excluded middle, choice, LPO, WLPO) as
     explicit assumptions for the theorems, or for the modules, that
     require them. As a consequence, we are able to tell very
     precisely which assumptions of HoTT/UF and classical mathematics,
     if any, we have used for each construction, theorem or set of
     results. We also work, deliberately, with a minimal subset of
     Agda.

   * There is also a module that links some "unsafe" modules that use
     type theory beyond MLTT and HoTT/UF, which cannot be included in
     this safe-modules index: The system with type-in-type is
     inconsistent (as is well known), countable Tychonoff, and
     compactness of the Cantor type using countable Tychonoff.

   * In our last count, this development has 126k lines, including
     comments and blank lines.

   * A module dependency graph is available, updated manually from
     time to time last tine on 19th December 2022:
     https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/TypeTopology/dependency-graph.pdf

   * There are some somewhat obsolete comments at the end of this
     file, explaining part of what we do in this development. See
     instead the comments in the various modules.

   * This has been tested with 2.6.2.1 and with the release
     candidates 2.6.3.

The UF modules (univalent foundations) have been developed, on demand,
for use in the other modules. The modules UF.Yoneda, UF.IdEmbedding
and UF.Factorial contain new results.
