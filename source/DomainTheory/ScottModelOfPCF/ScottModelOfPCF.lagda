The denotational semantics of PCF based on pointed directed complete posets.

The flag --lossy-unification significantly speeds up the
typechecking of the line ‚ü¶ S {œÅ} {œÉ} {œÑ} ‚üß‚Çë = S·µà·∂ú·µñ·µí‚ä• ‚ü¶ œÅ ‚üß ‚ü¶ œÉ ‚üß ‚ü¶ œÑ ‚üß below.

We consider the combinatory version of PCF here. This development was extended
to PCF with variables and Œª-abstraction by Brendan Hart in a final year project
supervised by Mart√≠n Escard√≥ and myself. Notably, Brendan's extension contains
an Agda formalization of soundness and computational adequacy.

Brendan's code, using a previous version of our library, can be found
here: https://github.com/BrendanHart/Investigating-Properties-of-PCF.

The repository also contains Brendan's report describing the project:
