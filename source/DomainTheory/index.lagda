Index for the formalization of domain theory, briefly describing the contents of
each directory, ordered almost¹ alphabetically by directory name.
(¹ Basics is first.)

Several additional domain-theoretic formalization targets are listed at the end.

Additional formalization targets
────────────────────────────────

The Formalization chapter in the aforementioned PhD thesis
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12405) details a few things (in the form of specific
lemmas) that have been left unformalized.

We present a succinct list of domain-theoretic formalization targets here:

1. Complete the formalization that bounded complete (continuous) dcpos with a
   small basis are closed under exponentials. It follows from the case of
   algebraic domains through a lemma that is left unformalized.
   See DomainTheory.BasesAndContinuity.StepFunctions for details.

2. Formalize the untyped λ-calculus and its interpretation in Scott's D∞.
   See DomainTheory.Bilimits.Dinfinity for the construction of D∞.

3. Formalize the results in reverse mathematics and delta-complete posets.
   See Chapter 6 of the PhD thesis for details.

4. Formalize the definition of the Scott topology of a (continuous) dcpo and
   show that the Scott opens form a frame, using Ayberk Tosun's formalization of
   frames and locales, see Locales.index.

   Additionally, show that the Scott topology of a continuous dcpo is spectral,
   as defined in Locales.CompactRegular.


Item 2 should be a fun challenge for a student with an interest in
(domain-theoretic semantics of) programming languages.

If you'd like to work on Item 4, please get in touch with Ayberk Tosun.
