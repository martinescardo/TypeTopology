{- Examples

1. The ideal completion of the dyadics is a nice example of a continuous dcpo
   (with a small basis) that cannot be algebraic as it has no compact elements
   at all.
2. The lifting of a large proposition P is an algebraic dcpo that has a small
   (compact) basis if and only if P is suitably small.
3. The type Ω of propositions is an example of a pointed algebraic dcpo with
   the booleans giving a small compact basis
4. The large poset of small ordinals is an example of an algebraic dcpo with no
   small compact basis

{-
  In the locale theory development, some results on the pointfree topology of
  domains have been proved by Ayberk Tosun. Most importantly, the fact that the
  Scott locale of a Scott domain is a spectral locale has been proved, which was
  previously listed as an additional formalization target in the list at the
  bottom of this module.

  Such results on the pointfree topology of domains can be found in the
  directory `Locales/ScottLocale`. The proof of spectrality is in the module
  `Locales.ScottLocale.ScottLocalesOfScottDomains`.

Additional formalization targets
────────────────────────────────

The Formalization chapter in the aforementioned PhD thesis
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12405) details a few things (in the form of specific
lemmas) that have been left unformalized.

We present a succinct list of domain-theoretic formalization targets here:

1. Complete the formalization that bounded complete (continuous) dcpos with a
   small basis are closed under exponentials. It follows from the case of
   algebraic domains through a lemma that is left unformalized.
   See DomainTheory.BasesAndContinuity.StepFunctions for details.

2. Formalize the untyped λ-calculus and its interpretation in Scott's D∞.
   See DomainTheory.Bilimits.Dinfinity for the construction of D∞.

3. Formalize the results in reverse mathematics and delta-complete posets.
   See Chapter 6 of the PhD thesis for details.

Item 2 should be a fun challenge for a student with an interest in
(domain-theoretic semantics of) programming languages.
